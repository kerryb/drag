# Drag

A spike playing with drag-and-drop in
[Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) LiveView, using vanilla
javascript. Simulates a board game where a player drags cards onto a table.

A second player’s cards are also shown, and a random one is played on the
opponent’s turn. The movement of these cards is animated using
[auto-animate](https://auto-animate.formkit.com/).
